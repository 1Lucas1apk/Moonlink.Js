**Moonlink.js Community Code of Conduct 🌙**

*On the Road to the Moon, harmony is our melody, and accessibility is our guiding constellation. Through our digital skies, we navigate with respect, patience, and excellence in every star we create.*

**I. Our Celestial Philosophy 🚀**
  
In Moonlink.js, our philosophy shines brightly: we do not confine ourselves to minimal package sizes. We believe that quality and completeness are essential constellations, empowering developers to achieve their musical goals. While others may sacrifice functionality in pursuit of minimalism, we strike a balance, offering a comprehensive package. This complete and robust approach is paramount to simplify and inspire the creation of exceptional music bots. 🌟

**II. The Stars of Our Objective 🌠**

On our journey, our primary objective is to make our Lavalink client package accessible to everyone. We commit to providing assistance whenever needed, with a dedicated focus on accessibility, regardless of package weight or other considerations.

**III. Navigating the Sky of Behavior 🌌**

In this realm, all community members are expected to follow respectful behavior guidelines. The path is forbidden for homophobic, racist, sexist, or any form of discriminatory behavior. In our community universe, patience and tolerance are guiding stars in all interactions.

**IV. Consequences in the Stars 🌠**

In case of code of conduct violations, astronomical measures will be taken. Those who break the rules more than three times may face banishment from the support server. On GitHub, inappropriate behavior will lead to an eclipse, with contributions ignored. However, redemption is a star that can shine again if there is a genuine plea for forgiveness.

**V. Help and Support from Our Comet 🛰️**

We are here to provide help and support. If you encounter challenges or have questions, our digital comet stands ready to assist you in navigating the cosmos. In the Discord server, a warm welcome awaits you, and at the end of our joint journey, we wish your day to be filled with starlight: "Have a great day!" ✨

**VI. The Map of the Code of Conduct 🗺️**

The map to our code of conduct resides in our Discord server, where you can access it at any time. [Link to the server](https://discord.gg/YxEbzPB7).

**VII. Education in the Stars 🌟**

On the Moon, we aim to make everyone aware of the guiding stars. Astronomical reminders will be shared, reminding everyone of the code of conduct guidelines and other relevant principles.

**VIII. Consistency in Application 🌌**

Shooting stars will be tested and reviewed regularly to maintain celestial standards. Cosmic errors will be corrected, and stellar updates will be released as needed.

Our Moonlink.js constellation shines with the promise of respect, excellence, and accessibility. Adhering to this code of conduct is paramount to maintaining harmony in our stellar community. If you have questions or need clarification, do not hesitate to contact us on our Discord server.
