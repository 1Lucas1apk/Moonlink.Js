# Introduction to Moonlink

Moonlink is a powerful JavaScript library designed to streamline various functionalities related to player and node management. This guide provides an overview of its structure and usage to help you integrate Moonlink seamlessly into your application.

## Understanding the Structure

At the core of Moonlink is the `MoonlinkManager` class, which serves as the primary interface for interacting with its features. This class encapsulates essential functionalities, including player and node management, ensuring a cohesive experience for developers.

### Player and Node Management

One of the key aspects of Moonlink is its modular approach to player and node management. By dividing responsibilities into distinct classes, such as `PlayerManager` and `NodeManager`, Moonlink enhances clarity and organization within your application.

#### Players

Players represent entities responsible for audio playback within a specific context, such as a Discord server. The `PlayerManager` class handles player-related operations, offering functions for retrieving existing players, creating new ones, and accessing player-specific functionalities.

##### Retrieving Players

To retrieve a player associated with a particular Discord server, you can use the `get` method:

```js
<moonlink>.players.get("myGuildIdDiscord")
```

##### Creating Players

Creating a new player involves specifying relevant parameters, such as the Discord guild ID and associated voice/text channels:

```js
<moonlink>.players.create({
  guildId: "id",
  voiceChannel: "voiceId",
  textChannel: "textId"
})
```

##### Accessing All Players

You can also retrieve all existing players within the application:

```js
<moonlink>.players.all
```

#### Node Management

Nodes are essential components in Moonlink responsible for handling audio streams and distributing workload efficiently. The `NodeManager` class facilitates node management operations, offering functionalities for adding, retrieving, and removing nodes.

##### Adding Nodes

To add a new node, you can use the `add` method, specifying parameters such as host, password, and port:

```js
<moonlink>.nodes.add({
  host: "example.com",
  password: "securePassword",
  port: 2333,
  // Other parameters...
})
```

##### Retrieving Nodes

You can retrieve a node using either its host or identifier:

```js
<moonlink>.nodes.get("example.com")
```

##### Removing Nodes

Removing a node from the system is straightforward using the `remove` method:

```js
<moonlink>.nodes.remove("example.com")
```

#### Initialization and Packet Updates

Before utilizing Moonlink, it's essential to initialize the package and handle packet updates. Initialization ensures proper synchronization with the client, while packet updates enable seamless integration with audio streaming servers.

```js
<moonlink>.init(clientId)
```

To handle packet updates, listen for raw data events from the client and pass them to Moonlink:

```js
<client>.on("raw", (data) => <moonlink>.packetUpdate(data))
```

### Understanding Lavalink

Lavalink serves as a simplified audio playback server, functioning as both an API and a WebSocket server for manipulating audio streams. It interfaces with LavaPlayer, which manages audio sources and related functionalities. Additionally, it includes Koe, similar to `@discordjs/Voice`, facilitating connections with Discord for audio transmission.
